                Optical character recognition systems aim to digitize paper
                documents to enable automated data search, retrieval, and
                processing with little to no human involvement. OCR systems can
                help optimize business workflow involving numerous manual tasks.
                Companies of different sizes can make the most of the technology
                to meet the consumersâ€™ needs for expedited and more secure
                goodsâ€™ shipment at a lower delivery cost.
